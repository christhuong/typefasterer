### Hi there 👋

```
Welcome to TypeFasterer! 👐

Type Fasterer is my first ever web-app designed 🎨 and developed 👨‍💻
back in my university days 🎓, using Vue and Firebase 🔥.

It contains lots of spaghettis🍝, but is indeed a useful app
with many features that help users practicing typing ⌨️ faster with
all ten fingers 🙌.

I hope you can find this app fun and helpful as I do. ☺️

Cheers! 🥂

### Setting it up! 🔨

# Compile and run on local machine browser
